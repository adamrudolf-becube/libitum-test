## Notes about React used

I used React for frontend rendering. I need to mention 2 things:

* I knew what React was and what the main concepts were, but otherwise I learned what I used for this project, while doing it, building this project practically from React tutorial. Please consider the React parts accordingly. My emphasis was on the backend.
* This React code is not optimised, it is built in a way to be the least complex to create and not the most optimal to be run. I am aware of that. (In this little project it doesn't really matter anyway.)
